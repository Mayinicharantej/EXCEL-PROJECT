# Vridha Stores Sales Analysis using Microsoft Excel

Welcome to my first data analysis project! This repository documents a comprehensive analysis of sales data for "Vridha Stores". The entire project, from data cleaning to creating an interactive dashboard, was performed using **Microsoft Excel**.

## üéØ Project Goals

The main objective of this project was to analyze the provided sales data to uncover insights and answer key business questions, such as:
* What is the overall sales performance?
* Which product categories are the most popular?
* What are the sales trends by gender and age group?
* Which states are the top contributors to sales?
* How do different payment methods compare?

## ‚öôÔ∏è My Process: An End-to-End Excel Analysis

This project demonstrates a full data analysis workflow within Microsoft Excel:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- **Initial Assessment:** Reviewed the raw dataset to identify inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting errors.
- **Data Cleaning:**
    - Used Excel functions like `TRIM` to remove extra spaces.
    - Corrected data types for columns (e.g., converting text to numbers).
    - Ensured consistency in categorical data (e.g., "Men" vs "M").
- **Data Transformation:** Formatted the data into an Excel Table to enable structured referencing and dynamic analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis & Processing
- **PivotTables:** Created multiple PivotTables to aggregate and summarize the data from different perspectives (e.g., sales by state, sales by category).
- **Calculations:** Used Excel formulas like `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and `AVERAGEIFS` to calculate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- **Data Modeling:** Linked different data slices to understand relationships between sales, customer demographics, and product details.

### 3. Dashboard Design & Visualization
- **Charts & Graphs:** Created various charts (Bar, Pie, Line) from the PivotTables to visualize trends and comparisons.
- **Interactivity:** Implemented **Slicers** to allow users to dynamically filter the dashboard by month, state, category, and more.
- **KPI Cards:** Designed clear cards to display crucial metrics like Total Revenue, Total Orders, and Average Order Value.
- **Layout & Formatting:** Arranged all visuals into a clean, professional, and easy-to-understand single-page dashboard.

## ‚ú® Key Insights & Recommendations (Example)

* **Insight:** The analysis revealed that the **Men's** category significantly outperforms the Women's category in sales revenue.
    * **Recommendation:** The marketing team should consider running targeted promotions on Women's apparel to boost sales in that segment.
* **Insight:** The **26-35 age group** represents the largest customer base by order volume.
    * **Recommendation:** Tailor marketing campaigns and product recommendations to appeal to this key demographic.
